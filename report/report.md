## 1. Introduction

Whenever people talk about sports, they will always talk about some kind of statistic to show that their team is performing well, or certain player(s) are playing incredibly well. This is due to the fact that statistics has become extremely important in sports, especially in rating an entity’s performance. While essentially every sport has adopted statistics to quantify performance, baseball is the most well-known sport to use it, due to the obscene number of stats that are tracked for each player and team, as well as the sport that uses stats the most in how they play the game. The MLB publishes about 85 different statistics for individual players, including the stats tracked of the teams, there is likely to be about double the amount if tracked statistics for the sport of baseball. The way that all the statistics are calculated, is, of course, by analyzing big data found from the players and teams. This report will mainly talk about the history of big data and data analytics in baseball, what the data is tracking, what we can learn from the data, and how the data is used. 


## 2. Dataset

The dataset that will be analyzed in this report will be the Lahmen Sabermetrics dataset. This dataset is a large dataset curated by Sean Lahmen, which contains baseball data starting from the year 1871, which is when the Major League Baseball association was founded [^1]. The dataset contains data for many different types of statistics, including batting stats, fielding stats, pitching stats, awards stats, player salaries, and games they played in. The data for this dataset has statistics from the last season that occurred (2020 season), but the data that could be accessed for this report is from 1871-2015. I plan to use this dataset for discussing later how the data in sets like this is used for statistical analysis in baseball and how teams can use this to their advantage. 

## 3. Background

The concept of baseball has been a sport that has existed for centuries, but the actual sport called baseball started in early to mid 1800s. Baseball became popularized in the United States in the 1850s, where a baseball craze hit the New York area, and baseball quickly was named a "national pastime." The first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, which was established in 1869, and the first professional league was established in 1871, and was called the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. This league only lasted a few years and was replaced by a more formally structured league called the National League in 1876, and the American League was established in 1901 from the Western League. A vast majority of the modern rules of baseball were in place by 1893, and the last major change was instituted in 1901 where foul balls are counted as strikes. The World Series was inaugurated in the fall of 1903, where the champion of the National League would play against the champion of the American League. During this time, there were many problems with the league, such as strikes due to poor and unequal pay and the discrimination of African Americans. The era in the time of the early 1900s was the first era of baseball, and the second era of baseball started in the 1920s where a plethora of changes to the game caused the sport to move from more of a "pitcher’s game" to a "hitter’s game," which was emphasized by the success of the first "power hitter" in professional baseball, Babe Ruth. In the 1960s, baseball was losing revenue due to the rising popularity of football, the league had to make changes to combat this drop in revenue and popularity. The changes lead to the salaries of the players getting increased and also an increase in attendance to games, which means increased revenue [^2]. 

Big data is able to be used in baseball through the use of statistics, which has become a major part in how the sport is played. The use of statistics in baseball has become known as "sabermetrics," which can be used by teams to make calls for the game based on numbers. The idea of using sabermetrics started from the book called *Moneyball*. The book was published in 2003, and was about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and how they were able to use sabermetric analysis to compete on equal grounds with teams that had much more money and good players than the A's team [^3]. This book has had a major impact on the way baseball is played today for several teams. For example, teams like the New York Yankees, the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Boston Red Sox have hired full-time sabermetric analysts in attempts to gain an edge over other teams by using these sabermetrics to influence their decisions. Also, the Tampa Bay Rays were able to make the "moneyball" idea a reality by making it to the 2020 World Series with a much lower budget team and using lots of sabermetrics in their decision-making [^3]. This "moneyball strategy" is not the perfect strategy however, because the Rays lost the World Series, and the turning point for their loss could be pointed to a decision they made based on what the analytics said they should do, which ended up being the wrong choice, which lost them a crucial game in the series.
