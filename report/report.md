## 1. Introduction

For my final project, I will not be in a team with other students, due to the fact that I do not know anyone in the class. I plan to only write a research paper and forgo the software component since I do not know what software I could make for this and I do not have the technical knowledge to make one. The topic I am planning to use for this project is big data in baseball and how it affects the sport. The sport of baseball has been one of the leading sports in the world when it comes to statistics in the sports since each player has several different stats for hitting, fielding, and pitching along with many other stats that are not affiliated with the actual players. I want to look at the data that is used for these stats and see what all is being tracked, as well as seeing how it is affecting the way the game is played. The dataset I plan on using is the Lahman Sabermetrics dataset, which is a massive dataset that has records from 1871-2014 that is to study baseball through statistical methods. 

There are several things I will need to make sure I do so that I can get a good grade for this project. One thing is that I need to figure out some more specific ideas I want to find in doing my research that I want to discuss in the project instead of doing something closer to an overview of what big data has done for baseball. Another is that I will need to find articles that will allow me to compare the way baseball was played back before big data and the way we play now. Another is that I need to find articles about how the raw data is used to create the statistics. Lastly, I will need to make sure and hit the 4000 word minimum on the project report and make everything in Github and use the kinds of files.

## 2. Plan

Talk about the history of big data and data analytics in baseball, what the data is tracking, what we can learn from the data, and how the data is used.
